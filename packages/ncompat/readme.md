# ncompat

> A compatibility layer between the official Notion API and the unofficial Notion API

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@texonom/ncompat.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@texonom/ncompat) [![Build Status](https://github.com/texonom/notion-node/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/texonom/notion-node/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![Prettier Code Formatting](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-brightgreen.svg)](https://prettier.io)

## Features

- Uses the official Notion API while keeping the response structure of the unofficial API

- fully compatible with `nreact`
- backwards compatible with `nclient` and the unofficial notion API

## Usage

```ts
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client'
import { NotionCompatAPI } from '@texonom/ncompat'

const notion = new NotionCompatAPI(new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN }))

const recordMap = await notion.getPage(pageId)
```

```ts
// searching works too
const results = await notion.search({ query: 'Texonom' })
```

The resulting `recordMap` is compatible with notion's unofficial API and nreact.

## API

Exports:

- `NotionCompatAPI` â€“ wrapper around '@notionhq/client'
- `convertPage({ pageId, blockMap })`
- `convertBlock({ block, blockMap })`
- `convertTime(time)`
- `convertColor(color)`
- `convertRichText(rich)`

## Difference from React Notion X

This layer lets you use the official API while retaining the features of the original unofficial client.

## Demo

You can preview `nreact` using the official client and compatibility layer here: https://nreact-official-api-demo.transitivebullsh.it/

## Status

Currently, ~20 blocks have full compatibility and 8 have partial compatibility (sometimes in subtle ways) due Notion's official API not returning enough info for us to faithfully render them in all cases. See the block-by-block compatibility notes below for more info.

I recommend checking out [the ncompat demo](https://nreact-official-api-demo.transitivebullsh.it/) side-by-side with the [normal nreact demo](https://nreact-demo.transitivebullsh.it/) (which uses the unofficial Notion API via `nclient`) and the [equivalent public notion page](https://transitive-bs.notion.site/Notion-Kit-Test-Suite-067dd719a912471ea9a3ac10710e7fdf).

Note that using the official API with `ncompat` is **significantly slower** than using the unofficial API via `nclient` because of [reasons](https://github.com/texonom/notion-node/issues/269#issuecomment-1100648873).

The main feature missing from `ncompat` right now is collection (database) support. PRs welcome ðŸ˜ƒ
